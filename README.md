# Real-time-face-recognition-using-SVD
The goal of this project is to develop a real-time system for face recognition using dimensionality reduction techniques. The cost (in terms of time and memory) to identify a face is greatly reduced by representing face images in a reduced subspace (called the \face space"), instead of using the original \image space" of m Ã— n pixels.
