This project explores one of the applications of a matrix's Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in image
recognition. The main idea is to reduce the dimension of an image so that SVD preserves
essential features of an image and helps reduce cost in terms of time and memory of the computer. We compare
the accuracy and time involved in identifying an image between dimension reduction using SVD and
original image space. We intend to explore the method to find the number of dimensions in SVD or columns
in left eigenvectors that we need to recognize an image on reduced face space. Furthermore, we also compare
results between our code for SVD and Python function for SVD. Moreover, we see how our result changes
when we define some threshold level to identify an image.
